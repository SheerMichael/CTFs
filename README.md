# CTFs

A personal collection of Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges Iâ€™ve solved â€” including challenge files, write-ups, and solutions.

## ðŸ“‚ Structure

Each directory corresponds to a platform, or difficulty level (depending on the event).  
Inside each challenge folder youâ€™ll usually find:

- **Challenge files** â€” provided by the CTF
- **Solution / Write-up** â€” step-by-step explanation of how I solved it
- **Scripts / Exploits** â€” code used during the solve
